## Lab6: Prompt Engineering
With the prompt templates extracted from the code, we can iterate on the prompts to fix the problem that we have observed!

Please iterate on the prompts and ensure the model can respond properly to our sample question.

## Exercises

Please find a prompt in our Chainlit application's playground that ensures our sample question is answered properly. And then edit `prompt.py` with the newly discovered/engineered prompt.
